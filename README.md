AWS Cloud Cost Optimization ‚Äì Identifying Stale EBS Snapshots with Lambda
üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates cloud cost optimization on AWS by automatically identifying and deleting stale EBS snapshots.
The Lambda function:

*Fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the account.

*Retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped).

*Checks if snapshots are linked to any active volume/instance.

*Deletes stale snapshots to optimize storage costs.

*Technology used: AWS Lambda, IAM, EC2, EBS, Boto3.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Implement
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an EC2 Instance & Snapshot

*Launch a t2.micro / t3.micro EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible).

*Attach an EBS volume if not already present.

*Create a snapshot of the attached EBS volume.

*Stop and terminate the EC2 instance ‚Üí snapshot remains in the account.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Lambda Function

*Go to AWS Lambda ‚Üí Create function.

*Choose Author from scratch.

*Add the following Boto3 code:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create IAM Role for Lambda

*Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create role.

*Select Lambda as trusted entity.

*Attach a custom policy with permissions

*Name it LambdaEBSStaleCleanupRole.

*Attach this role to the Lambda function.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Lambda Function

*First run ‚Üí no snapshot deleted if EC2 is active.

*Delete your EC2 instance ‚Üí snapshots remain.

*Re-run the Lambda ‚Üí stale snapshots are deleted.

‚úÖ Outcome

*Any orphaned snapshots (not linked to an active instance/volume) are automatically deleted.

*This reduces unnecessary storage costs in AWS.
